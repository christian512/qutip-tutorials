# Simulating randomized benchmarking

In this example, we will reproduce a randomized benchmarking experiment used in Figure 3a of [Piltz et. al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms5679?origin=ppub)

Note: This example is quite computationally expensivem, hence for the full simulation we use [joblib](https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for parallel computing. However, you don't need this to run the demo.


```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import qutip_qip
from qutip import (Qobj, SolverOptions, basis, fock_dm, qeye, sigmax, sigmay,
                   sigmaz, tensor)
from qutip.ipynbtools import version_table
from qutip_qip.circuit import QubitCircuit
from qutip_qip.compiler import GateCompiler, Instruction
from qutip_qip.device import Model, ModelProcessor
from qutip_qip.noise import Noise
from qutip_qip.operations import Gate
from scipy.optimize import curve_fit
```

We build a two-qubit Processor, where the second qubit is detuned from the first one by $\delta= 1.852$MHz. A sequence of $\pi$-pulses with Rabi frequency of $\Omega= 20$KHz and random phases are applied to the first qubit. We define noise such that the same pulse also applies to the second qubit. Because of the detuning, this pulse does not flip the second qubit but subjects it to a diffusive behaviour, so that the average fidelity of the second qubit with respect to the initial state decreases.

Here, we reproduce these results with a two-qubit `Processor`.
We start with an initial state of fidelity 0.975 and simulate the Hamiltonian
\begin{align}
H=\Omega(t)(\sigma^x_0 + \lambda \sigma^x_1) + \delta\sigma^z_1
,
\end{align}
where $\lambda$ is the ratio between the cross-talk pulse's amplitudes.


In the cell below, we first build a Hamiltonian model called `MyModel`.
For simplicity, we only include two single-qubit control Hamiltonians: $\sigma_x$ and $\sigma_y$.
We then define the compiling routines for the two types of rotation gates RX and RY.
In addition, we also define a rotation gate with mixed X and Y quadrature, parameterized by a phase $\phi$, $\cos(\phi)\sigma_x+\sin(\phi)\sigma_y$.
This will be used later in the example of custom noise.

We then initialize a `ModelProcessor` with this model.
In the `ModelProcessor`, the default simulation workflow is already defined, such as the `load_circuit` method.
Since rotations around the $x$ and $y$ axes are the native gates of our hardware, we define them in the attribute \texttt{native\_gates}.
Providing this native gates set, rotation around $z$ axis will be automatically decomposed into rotations around $x$ and $y$ axes.
We define a circuit consisting of $\pi/2$ rotation followed by a Z gate.
The compiled pulses are shown in \cref{fig:customize pulse}, where the Z gate is decomposed into rotations around $x$ and $y$ axes.

We now define a custom `ClassicalCrossTalk` noise object that uses the `Noise` class as the base.
The `get_noisy_dynamics` method will be called during the simulation to generate the noisy Hamiltonian model.
Here, we define a noise model that adds the same driving Hamiltonian to its neighbouring qubits, with a strength proportional to the control pulses strength applied on it.
The detuning of the qubit transition frequency is simulated by adding a $\sigma_z$ drift Hamiltonian to the processor, with a frequency of $1.852$ MHz.

class ClassicalCrossTalk(Noise):
    def __init__(self, ratio):
        self.ratio = ratio

        for i, pulse in enumerate(pulses):

                continue  # filter out other pulses, e.g. drift
            target = pulse.targets[0]
            if target != 0:  # add pulse to the left neighbour
                pulses[i].add_control_noise(
                    self.ratio * pulse.qobj,
                    targets=[target - 1],

                )
        return pulses, systematic_noise
```

Lastly, we define a random circuit consisting of a sequence of $\pi$ rotation pulses with random phases.
The driving pulse is a $\pi$ pulse with a duration of $25 \, \mu\rm{s}$ and Rabi frequency $20$ KHz.
This randomized benchmarking protocol allows one to study the classical cross-talk induced decoherence on the neighbouring qubits.
The two qubits are initialized in the $|00\rangle$ state with a fidelity of 0.975.
After the circuit, we measure the population of the second qubit.
If there is no cross-talk, it will remain perfectly in the ground state.
However, cross-talk induces a diffusive behaviour of the second qubit and the fidelity decreases.

This simulation is repeated 1600 times to obtain the average fidelity. This may take several hours, therefore, the following code only takes two samples with $t=250$. The full simulation is in the commented lines.
